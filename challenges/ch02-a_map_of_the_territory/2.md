Just-in-time compilation tends to be the fastest way to implement dynamically typed languages, but not all of them use it. What reasons are there to not JIT?

I think it would tie you to a specific type of CPU.

Checked the answer, that's one of them, the other listed reasons are complexity, increased memory demands, and some platforms expressly disallow executing code at runtime.
